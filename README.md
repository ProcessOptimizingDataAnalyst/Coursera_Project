For the Excel to MySQL: Analytic Techniques for Business Specialization's final project, I was tasked, as a data analyst of a property management firm, with making recommendations to the company to enhance their book performance. To do so I:

- Extracted relevant data from MySQL database.
- Developed financial models using Excel to analyze the data extracted from the database, predict the property management firmâ€™s short-term rents, as well as cash flows and profits it would experience if it converted properties to short-term rentals.
- Created a Tableau dashboard to support decision making.
